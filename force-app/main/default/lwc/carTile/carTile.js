            'pubsub' model is same like 'Application Event' in lightning Aura component.
            There are two ways to communicate between independent component (i.e. components that arenâ€™t in the same DOM tree):
                1. publish-subscribe pattern (pubsub model)
                2. Lightning message channel
            To communicate between components on a single page, you can use the pubsub module.
                For example, if you add two components to a Lightning page in Lightning App Builder, use the pubsub module to send events between them. 
                The pubsub module restricts events to a single page.
            'Lightning message channel' : To communicate between components within a single Lightning page or across multiple pages.
